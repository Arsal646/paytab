                                All lessor’s leased vehicles are insured
                                including against third party liability
                                in respect of death and bodily injury with an
                                excess of Dhs.2,000/= (UAE Dirhams: Two Thousand
                                only) each
                                claim. Accordingly in respect of every claim
                                under the insurance policy which is not rejected
                                / objected to
                                by the insurer, the lessee will pay the first

                                lessor.

                                Please bear in mind that the insurance is null
                                and void if the driver is found to
